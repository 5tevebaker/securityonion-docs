Stenographer
============

From https://github.com/google/stenographer:

    Stenographer is a full-packet-capture utility for buffering packets to disk for intrusion detection and incident response purposes. It provides a high-performance implementation of NIC-to-disk packet writing, handles deleting those files as disk fills up, and provides methods for reading back specific sets of packets quickly and easily.

Analysis
--------

You can access full packet capture via Security Onion Console (SOC). Kibana and Hunt allow you to easily pivot to SOC for pcap.
