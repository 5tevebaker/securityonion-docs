Use Cases
=========

Security Onion is designed for many different use cases! Here are just a few examples.

Evaluation
----------

``Evaluation Mode`` is ideal for classroom or small lab environments. Evaluation is not designed for production usage.

For more information, please see the :ref:`quick-iso-image` section.

Production Server - Standalone

Standalone is similar to Evaluation in that it only requires a single box, but Standalone is more rready for production usage.
