Hunt
====

Security Onion Console (SOC) gives you access to our new Hunt interface. This interface allows you to hunt through all of the data in Elasticsearch and is highly tuned for stacking, pivoting, data expansion, and data reduction.

To get started, click the Search drop down box and select one of the predefined queries. If results are found, Hunt will render three main sections of output. The first section contains a Most Occurences visualization, a timeline visualization, and a Fewest Occurences visualization. The middle section allows you to stack (aggegrate) arbitrary fields. The third and final section is a data table that contains all search results and allows you to drill into individual search results as necessary. The search results data table allows you to pivot to pcap for network streams. Click the first pcap link to use the current window or use the second pcap link to open pcap in a new window.
