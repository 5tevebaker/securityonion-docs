Zeek
====

Zeek is formerly known as Bro.  From https://www.zeek.org/:

    Zeek is a powerful network analysis framework that is much different from the typical IDS you may know. (Zeek is the new name for the long-established Bro system. Note that parts of the system retain the "Bro" name, and it also often appears in the documentation and distributions.)

Performance
-----------

Zeek uses :ref:`af-packet` so that you can spin up multiple Zeek workers to handle more traffic.  

To change the number of AF-PACKET workers for :ref:`zeek`:

-  Stop Zeek:

   ::

      sudo so-zeek-stop

-  Edit ``/opt/so/saltstack/local/pillar/minions/$SENSORNAME_$ROLE.sls`` and change the ``bro_lbprocs`` variable to the desired number of cores.

-  Start Zeek:

   ::

      sudo so-zeek-start
      
For best performance, Zeek should be pinned to specific CPUs. In most cases, youâ€™ll want to pin sniffing processes to the same CPU that your sniffing NIC is bound to.  You can do this using the ``pin_cpus`` setting as shown at https://docs.zeek.org/en/stable/configuration/#using-pf-ring.

Community ID
------------

We enable Zeek's native support for :ref:`community-id`.

Logs
----

Zeek logs are stored in ``/nsm/zeek/logs``. They are collected by :ref:`filebeat` or :ref:`logstash`, parsed by and stored in :ref:`elasticsearch`, and viewable in :ref:`hunt` and :ref:`kibana`.

We configure Zeek to output logs in JSON format. If you need to parse those JSON logs from the command line, you can use :ref:`jq`.

Zeek monitors your network traffic and creates logs, such as:

conn.log
~~~~~~~~

-  TCP/UDP/ICMP connections

-  For more information, see:

https://docs.zeek.org/en/latest/scripts/base/protocols/conn/main.zeek.html#type-Conn::Info

dns.log
~~~~~~~

-  DNS activity

-  For more information, see:

https://docs.zeek.org/en/latest/scripts/base/protocols/dns/main.zeek.html#type-DNS::Info

ftp.log
~~~~~~~

-  FTP activity

-  For more information, see:

https://docs.zeek.org/en/latest/scripts/base/protocols/ftp/info.zeek.html#type-FTP::Info

http.log
~~~~~~~~

-  HTTP requests and replies

-  For more information, see:

https://docs.zeek.org/en/latest/scripts/base/protocols/http/main.zeek.html#type-HTTP::Info

ssl.log
~~~~~~~

-  SSL/TLS handshake info

-  For more information, see:

https://docs.zeek.org/en/latest/scripts/base/protocols/ssl/main.zeek.html#type-SSL::Info

notice.log
~~~~~~~~~~

-  Zeek notices

-  For more information, see:

https://docs.zeek.org/en/latest/scripts/base/frameworks/notice/main.zeek.html#type-Notice::Info

| ...and others, which can be researched here:
| https://docs.zeek.org/en/latest/script-reference/log-files.html

As you can see, Zeek log data can provide a wealth of information to the analyst, all easily accessible through :ref:`kibana`.

Email
-----

-  To configure email notifications, please see the :ref:`email` section.

Syslog
------

-  To forward Zeek logs to an external syslog collector, please see the :ref:`syslog-output` section.

Intel
-----

-  You can add your own Intel to ``/opt/zeek/share/zeek/intel/intel.dat``.

   -  When editing ``/opt/zeek/share/intel/intel.dat``, ensure there are no leading/trailing spaces or lines, and that only (single) tabs are used as field delimiters.
   -  If you experience an error, or do not notice ``/nsm/zeek/logs/current/intel.log`` being generated, try having a look in ``/nsm/zeek/logs/current/reporter.log`` for clues.
   -  You may also want to restart Zeek after making changes, by running the following command:
      \ ``sudo so-zeek-restart``.
