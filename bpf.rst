BPF

Configuration
-------------

Global bpf.conf
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can specify your BPF in ``/etc/nsm/rules/bpf.conf`` on your management server and, by default, it will apply to Suricata/Zeek/Stenographer on all interfaces in your entire deployment. If you have separate sensors reporting to that management server, they will copy ``/etc/nsm/rules/bpf.conf`` as part of the daily rule-update cron job (or you can run it manually) which will also restart Suricata so that the BPF change will take effect. Zeek automatically monitors ``bpf.conf`` for changes and will update itself as needed. Other services (such as Stenographer) will need to be restarted manually for the change to take effect.

BPF Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Exclude traffic to/from a host:

::

   !(host xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx)
   
   
Exclude traffic from a source host to a destination port:

::

    !(src host xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx && dst port 161)
    
Combine multiple BPFs together using ``&&``, but note that the last entry has no final ``&&``:
::

    #Nothing from src host to dst port
    !(src host xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx && dst port 161) &&

    #Nothing from src host to dst host and dst port
    !(src host xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx && dst host xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx && dst port 80) &&

    #Nothing to or from:
    !(host xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx) &&

    #Last entry has no final &&
    !(host xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx)

VLAN
~~~~
From Seth Hall regarding VLAN tags:

::

    (not (host 192.168.53.254 or host 192.168.53.60 or host 192.168.53.69 or host 192.168.53.234)) or (vlan and (not (host 192.168.53.254 or host 192.168.53.60 or host 192.168.53.69 or host 192.168.53.234)))

This amazingly works if you are only using it to restrict the traffic
passing through the filter. The basic template isâ€¦

::

    <your filter> and (vlan and <your filter>)

Once the ``vlan`` tag is included in the filter, all subsequent
expressions to the right are shifted by four bytes so you need to
duplicate the filter on both sides of the vlan keyword. There are edge
cases where this will no longer work and probably edge cases where a few
undesired packets will make it though, but it should work in the example
case that you've given.

Also, I'm assuming that any tools you are running will support vlan tags
and no tags simultaneously.

Troubleshooting BPF using tcpdump
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you need to troubleshoot BPF, you can use ``tcpdump`` as shown in the following articles.
