Elastic Stack
=============

We've integrated the Elastic Stack:

| `<Elasticsearch>`__
| `<Logstash>`__
| `<Kibana>`__

In addition, we've added the following:

| `Curator <Curator>`__
| `DomainStats <DomainStats>`__
| `ElastAlert <ElastAlert>`__
| `FreqServer <FreqServer>`__

Each of the components above has its own `<Docker>`__ image.

You can get an idea of what this whole integration looks like at a high-level by viewing our `architecture
diagram <Elastic-Architecture>`__.

Hardware Requirements
---------------------

Please note the following MINIMUM requirements for the Elastic stack:

-  2 CPU cores
