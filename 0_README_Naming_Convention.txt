New documentation pages should use the following naming convention:
- all lowercase
- .rst file extension
- if possible, one word with no punctuation (hyphens or underscores)
- if punctuation is required, hyphens are preferred to underscores

The end goal is to allow a user to easily guess and type the documentation page they want to go to.

For example, if I want to read more about Suricata, I should be able to type the following into my browser:
https://securityonion.net/docs/suricata
