TheHive
=======

From https://thehive-project.org/:

    A scalable, open source and free Security Incident Response Platform, tightly integrated with MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform), designed to make life easier for SOCs, CSIRTs, CERTs and any information security practitioner dealing with security incidents that need to be investigated and acted upon swiftly.
    
Usage
-----

Security Onion Console (SOC) provides a link to TheHive. TheHive should display the highest level of alerts. You can then triage those alerts and turn them into cases if necessary. Other analysts can collaborate with you as you work to close those cases. As you are working through a case and need more context, you can pivot to Kibana or Hunt as necessary.
