Elastic Auth
============

Starting in Elastic 6.8.0, Elastic authentication is included for free in :ref:`elastic-features`.  This allows you to assign different privileges to different users in Kibana.

To enable, simply run ``so-elastic-auth`` on your management server only (or standalone) and follow the prompts.  ``so-elastic-auth`` will do the following:

- walk you through switching to Elastic Features if necessary

- enable authentication in Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana, Curator, and ElastAlert

Once you've completed ``so-elastic-auth``, you should then:

- log into Kibana using the ``elastic`` super-user account

- set any other account privileges as necessary

- distribute the temporary passwords generated by ``so-elastic-auth`` to your users and have them reset their passwords

.. note::

  If you add new Elastic Auth accounts in the future, you will need to assign them at least the ``so_user_read_only`` role.
