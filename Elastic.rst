Elastic Stack
=============

We've integrated the Elastic Stack (`Elasticsearch <Elasticsearch>`__, `Logstash <Logstash>`__, and
`Kibana <Kibana>`__)!

In addition, we've added the following:

| `Curator <Curator>`__
| `DomainStats <DomainStats>`__
| `ElastAlert <ElastAlert>`__
| `FreqServer <FreqServer>`__

Each component has its own `Docker <Docker>`__ image.

You can get an idea of what this whole integration looks like at a high-level by viewing our `architecture
diagram <Elastic-Architecture>`__.
