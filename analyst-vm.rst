Analyst VM
==========

Full-time analysts may want to create a dedicated Analyst VM. This allows you to investigate pcaps without fear of impacting your Security Onion deployment or your workstation.

To connect from the Analyst VM to your manager node, you will need to run :ref:`so-allow` on the manager node and choose the ``analyst`` option to allow the traffic through the host-based :ref:`firewall`.
