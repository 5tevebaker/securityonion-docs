Analyst VM
==========

Full-time analysts should install Security Onion in a VM on their workstation. Run through the Ubuntu installer, but you do not need to run our Setup wizard since the analyst VM won't be sniffing any live traffic. This gives you a local copy of `Wireshark <wireshark>`_, `NetworkMiner <networkminer>`_, and our customized `<Sguil>`_ client. 

To connect from the Analyst VM to your production master server, you will need to run `<so-allow>`_ on the master server and choose the ``analyst`` option to allow the traffic through the host-based `firewall <Firewall>`_.

Once youâ€™ve allowed the traffic using so-allow, you can launch the Sguil client and connect to the IP address or hostname of your production master server and/or launch the web browser and connect to Squert or Kibana on your production master server.

This allows you to investigate pcaps without fear of impacting your production server/sensors.
