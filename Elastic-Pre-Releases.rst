GA now available
================

| Our Elastic Stack integration has reached General Availability! We
  highly recommend performing a fresh installation rather than trying to
  upgrade pre-release installations!
| https://blog.securityonion.net/2018/04/security-onion-elastic-stack-general.html

We do not support upgrading pre-releases to GA, but if you want to try,
you can try the following:

-  `Alpha to Beta <Elastic-Alpha-to-Beta>`__
-  `Beta to RC1 <Elastic-RC1>`__
-  `RC1 to RC2 <Elastic-RC2>`__
-  `RC2 to RC3 <Elastic-RC3>`__
-  `RC3 to RC4 <Elastic-RC4>`__
