Use Cases
=========

Security Onion is designed for many different use cases! Here are just a few examples.

.. tip::

  If this is your first time using Security Onion and you just want to try it out, we recommend installing our Security Onion ISO image in in a virtual machine and selecting the Evaluation option as it's the quickest and easiest way to get started.

Evaluation
----------

The ``EVAL`` option allows you to quickly and easily evaluate Security Onion. It works well for classroom or small lab environments. Evaluation is **not** designed for production usage.

For more information, please see the :ref:`quick-iso-image` section.

Production Server - Standalone
------------------------------

Standalone is similar to Evaluation in that it only requires a single box, but Standalone is more ready for production usage. 

For more information, please see the :ref:`production-deployment` section.

Production Server - Distributed Deployment
------------------------------------------

Install Security Onion on the manager node. Then install Security Onion on one or more forward, search, or heavy nodes and join to the manager node.

For more information, please see the :ref:`production-deployment` section.

Sending Logs to Separate SIEM
-----------------------------

You can install Security Onion and then configure it to send logs to a separate SIEM.

For more information, please see the :ref:`syslog-output` section.
