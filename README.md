[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/securityonion/badge/?version=latest)](https://securityonion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

This repo stores the source code for our documentation which is published by ReadTheDocs at:
https://securityonion.net/docs

We use RST format so that ReadTheDocs can publish in both HTML and PDF formats.

# Contributing

If you notice any documentation is missing or incorrect, please feel free to submit a pull request (PR) to this repo.  We will review the PR and merge if appropriate.

# Naming Convention
Our goal is to allow you to easily guess and type the URL of the documentation you want to go to.

For example, if you want to read more about Suricata, you can type the following into your browser:
https://securityonion.net/docs/suricata

To achieve this goal, new documentation pages should use the following naming convention:
- all lowercase
- `.rst` file extension
- ideally, the name of the page should be one simple word (for example: `suricata.rst`)
- try to avoid symbols if possible
- if symbols are required, use hyphens (NOT underscores)
