Booting Issues
==============

-  Did you verify the downloaded ISO image as described on the
   `Installation <Installation>`__ page?
-  Does your machine support 64-bit? (If you're trying to run a 64-bit
   VM, then your 64-bit processor must support virtualization and
   virtualization must be enabled in the BIOS.) If not, then you'll need
   to obtain a 64-bit machine to use our 64-bit ISO image (recommended).
-  If you think your machine does support 64-bit, but you're still
   having problems with our 64-bit ISO image, try downloading the standard Ubuntu
   18.04 64-bit ISO image or CentOS 7 64-bit ISO image and seeing if they run. If they don't, then you
   should verify your 64-bit compatibility.
-  | If all else fails but standard CentOS 7 64-bit or Ubuntu 18.04 64-bit installs normally, then you can always install our components on top of them as described on the following pages:
