Please keep in mind that our Google Groups are moderated, so your email will have to be approved before it is published to the list. If at first you don't see your email appear in the mailing list, there is no need to re-send your email. It has been queued and will be approved if appropriate.

Questions/Problems
------------------

Start a new thread instead of replying to an old one
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please search the mailing list to see if you can find similar issues that may help you. However, please do not reply to old threads with your new issue. Instead, please start a new thread and provide a hyperlink to the related discussion at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/security-onion.

Avoid generic OS questions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Security Onion is based on a standard Linux distribution. Quite often, folks ask the Security Onion mailing list for help with Linux issues not strictly related to Security Onion. In order to keep the signal-to-noise ratio as high as possible, the Security Onion mailing list should only be used for questions directly relating to Security Onion itself. If you have questions about Linux, you should search Google for other forums or relevant information.

Provide sufficient technical info
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| In order to be as effective and efficient as possible, please consider the following when posing your question/problem to the group:
| http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html

- Prefix the subject of your post with [2.0] so that we know that you're asking about Security Onion 2.0

Please include the following details where you can:

- Exact version. ex. 2.0.0

- Install source. Did you install from our Security Onion ISO image or did you perform a network installation?

- If network install, did you install from Ubuntu 18.04 or CentOS 7?

- Install type. ex. eval, standalone, forward node, search node, etc

- Does so-status show all services running?

- Do you get any failures when you run ``salt-call state.highstate``?

- Explain your issue. For example: ``Installation fails when I select this series of options...``
