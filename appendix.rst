Appendix
========

This appendix covers the process of upgrading from the old Security Onion 16.04 to the new Security Onion 2.0.

WARNING! Please note the following:

 - Security Onion 2.0 has higher hardware requirements, so you should verify that your hardware meets those requirements. 
 - We do not provide any guarantees that this process will work! If the upgrade fails, please be prepared to perform a fresh installation of Security Onion 2.0.
 - Once you've upgraded from Ubuntu 16.04 to Ubuntu 18.04, you will essentially do a new installation on Ubuntu 18.04.  Very little data will be retained during the upgrade!
 - There will be no way to migrate user accounts from 16.04 to 2.0.
 - There will be no way to access sguild data from 16.04 to 2.0.
 - Any pcap stored in 16.04 can only be accessed via tcpdump.
 
For the reasons listed above, we recommend that most users procure new hardware and perform a fresh installation of Security Onion 2.0.

If you have reviewed all of the warnings above and still want to attempt an in-place upgrade, you should be able to do the following:

 - perform an in-place upgrade from Ubuntu 16.04 to Ubuntu 18.04 using standard Ubuntu procedures
 - once you have completed the Ubuntu 18.04 upgrade, follow the Ubuntu 18.04 instructions in the Installation Guide
